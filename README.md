<h1 align="center">AI-Powered Kitchen Ecosystem </h1>

The AI-Powered Kitchen Ecosystem is a comprehensive research initiative designed to address the global challenges of food waste and poor nutrition through an integrated, AI-driven platform. This holistic system seamlessly
combines four specialized modules:

1. Spontaneous Cooking Assistant that uses advanced computer vision to identify available ingredients and suggest relevant recipes.

2. Nutritional Guidance and Predictive Health Intervention System that uses AI and Machine Learning to forecast nutrient deficiencies and provide personalized dietary recommendations.

3. AI Shopping Agent that provides voice-enabled, intelligent product search and cross-platform price comparisons.

4. Behavioral Food Expiry Predictor that learns from user habits to deliver personalized spoilage alerts.

Together, these components create a synergistic workflow that
supports the entire food lifecycle, from planning and purchasing to cooking and consumption, fostering sustainable household practices and reducing waste.
