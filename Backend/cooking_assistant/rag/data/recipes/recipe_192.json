  "cultural_notes": "The sourness from goraka is irreplaceable - never substitute with tamarind. Best eaten with red rice. Use fresh fish from coastal markets. Goraka (garcinia) is essential for authentic sour taste - never substitute with tamarind. The curry should have a deep red color from roasted spices.",
